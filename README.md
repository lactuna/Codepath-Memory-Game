## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
My greatest challenge was keeping track of how each piece of code interacted with each other and not blidnly copy pasting.
This is because I wanted to take the most out of the learning and hands on opportunity given to me by applying for this internship. 
For a while, I was confused as to how the "guess" function would work within the code, 
as the function was not called by any of the other JavaScript functions. Then I saw how I 
added the function minutes earlier in the HTML file to be called when the user clicks on a button.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
My current question about web development is regarding how extensive the use of templates are. 
Many of the features that were discussed in pre-work assignment are almost standard across many websites, i.e. highlighting buttons. 
For this reason, I wonder if web developers have certain aspects of code already set for each project that they take on.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I think that I woudld have added every additional feature suggested. It would have been good practice for me to try HTML, CSS, and JS 
without the extensive guidance given during the rest of the pre-work assignment. One thing I would focus on is trying to use sounds and 
images from the "A Song of Ice and Fire" book series, of which I based the title of the project on.
